#Question: https://leetcode.com/problems/populating-next-right-pointers-in-each-node/

#Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node
#Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL.
#Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.

class Solution {
   public Node connect(Node root) {
        if (root == null) return null;

        Node cur = root; #Start from the root node
        Node nextLeftMost = null;

        while (cur.left != null) {
            nextLeftMost = cur.left; // Saving the start of next level

            while (cur != null) {
                cur.left.next = cur.right;
                cur.right.next = cur.next == null ? null : cur.next.left;
                cur = cur.next;
            }
            cur = nextLeftMost;
        }
        return root;
    }
}
